# FinNovate 💸

A financial literacy web application designed for the **ACEATHON 2025** Finance theme. FinNovate provides a guided journey to help Indian students transition from managing education debt to building long-term wealth.

## 🎯 The Problem
With over **₹90,000 crore in outstanding education loans** and a national **financial literacy rate of only 27%**, India's youth face significant financial challenges upon graduation. This lack of financial knowledge often leads to increased loan defaults (NPAs), financial stress, and a delay in personal wealth creation, which limits the economic potential of our demographic dividend.

## ✨ Our Solution
FinNovate tackles this problem with a unique **"Debt-First" approach** that focuses on the most immediate financial concern for students: their education loan. Our platform is a complete, step-by-step guide that takes users from learning the absolute basics to building their own personalized financial plan.

## 🚀 Key Features
Our application follows a simple three-step methodology:

* **1. Learn 📚**
    * Access curated, bite-sized micro-learning modules on essential Indian financial topics like CIBIL scores, SIPs, and retirement planning. Each 5-minute lesson includes interactive quizzes to ensure comprehension.

* **2. Practice 🕹️**
    * Apply knowledge in a hyper-realistic, **risk-free simulation engine**. Users can practice investing with virtual money on a simulated Indian stock market (NSE/BSE) or model different repayment strategies for their education loan.

* **3. Plan 📈**
    * Transition from practice to reality with **personalized financial roadmaps**. The app analyzes simulation performance to generate actionable insights, including optimized debt repayment schedules and custom investment strategies.
