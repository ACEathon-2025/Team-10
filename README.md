# FinNovate 💸

[cite_start]A financial literacy web application designed for the **ACEATHON 2025** Finance theme[cite: 1, 8]. [cite_start]FinNovate provides a guided journey to help Indian students transition from managing education debt to building long-term wealth[cite: 50].

## 🎯 The Problem
[cite_start]With over **₹90,000 crore in outstanding education loans** and a national **financial literacy rate of only 27%**, India's youth face significant financial challenges upon graduation[cite: 11]. [cite_start]This lack of financial knowledge often leads to increased loan defaults (NPAs), financial stress, and a delay in personal wealth creation, which limits the economic potential of our demographic dividend[cite: 13].

## ✨ Our Solution
[cite_start]FinNovate tackles this problem with a unique **"Debt-First" approach** that focuses on the most immediate financial concern for students: their education loan[cite: 15, 49]. [cite_start]Our platform is a complete, step-by-step guide that takes users from learning the absolute basics to building their own personalized financial plan[cite: 16, 17].

## 🚀 Key Features

* **2. Practice 🕹️**
    * [cite_start]Apply knowledge in a hyper-realistic, **risk-free simulation engine**[cite: 23]. [cite_start]Users can practice investing with virtual money on a simulated Indian stock market (NSE/BSE) or model different repayment strategies for their education loan[cite: 24].
