            <h2>What is the Debt Snowball?</h2>
            <p>
                The Debt Snowball method is a debt-reduction strategy that focuses on building momentum through psychological wins. Instead of prioritizing debts by interest rate, you tackle them from the smallest balance to the largest. As you pay off each small debt, you gain confidence and "roll" that payment into the next one, creating an unstoppable snowball of debt repayment.

            <div className="steps-container">
                <div className="step-item"><p><b>List Your Debts:</b> Write down all your debts (excluding your mortgage) from the smallest balance to the largest.</p></div>
                <div className="step-item"><p><b>Focus on the Smallest:</b> Make minimum payments on all your debts except for the one with the smallest balance.</p></div>
                <div className="step-item"><p><b>Attack It:</b> Throw every extra rupee you can find at that smallest debt until it's gone. Sell things, pick up extra hoursâ€”get intense!</p></div>
                <div className="step-item"><p><b>Roll It Up:</b> Once the smallest debt is paid off, take its payment amount and add it to the minimum payment of the next-smallest debt.</p></div>
                <div className="step-item"><p><b>Repeat:</b> Continue this process, rolling each freed-up payment into the next debt until you're completely debt-free.</p></div>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mathematically Inefficient:</strong> By ignoring interest rates, you may pay more in total interest over time compared to the Debt Avalanche method.</li>
